# SurgiSense: Post-Operative Complication Risk Predictor

## Overview
SurgiSense is an open-source AI project designed to predict post-operative complications using interpretable machine learning. Built with a focus on transparency, clinical relevance, and ease of deployment, SurgiSense aims to support clinicians in real-time surgical risk assessment.

## Project Status

- ✅ Data loader module complete (`load_data.py`)
- ✅ Preprocessing utilities implemented (`utils.py`)
- ✅ Dataset exploration + EDA complete (`eda.ipynb`)
- ✅ First model trained using Random Forest + SHAP interpretability (`eda_complete.ipynb`)
- 🟡 Additional model prototyping in progress (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- ⬜ Streamlit-based demo interface (in development)

## Goals
- Simulate or collect real-world post-operative patient data
- Train classification models to predict complications
- Evaluate performance (e.g., AUC, precision, recall)
- Provide explainability using SHAP or similar tools
- Deploy as an API or Streamlit app for demos

## Dependencies
See `requirements.txt` for the list of Python packages.
